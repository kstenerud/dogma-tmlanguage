## About the Dogma Metalanguage

[Dogma](https://dogma-lang.org/) is a human-friendly metalanguage for describing data formats (text or binary) in documentation.

[Dogma](https://dogma-lang.org/) follows the familiar patterns of [Backus-Naur Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form), with a number of innovations that make it also suitable for describing binary data.

## Known Issues

TextMate syntax highlighters are limited in their power, and so it is possible to write invalid CTE code that the syntax highlighter will accept.
